# 📁 File Uploader

In this project, I built a **simplified version of a personal cloud storage service** - think **Google Drive**, but stripped down to the essentials.

Users can **sign up**, **create folders**, **upload files**, and later **download** or **view file details**. The app also includes optional **folder sharing via time-limited public links**.

The project deepened my experience with **user authentication**, **file handling**, **database management** with **ORMs**, and **cloud storage integration**.
